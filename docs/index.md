## Hello, World

Here is a computation of the Wasserstein 2 distance between a sum of diracs and a spline grid:

```python
import numpy as np
import sdot

f = sdot.SumOfDiracs( np.random.rand( 1000, 2 ) ) # 1000 equal-weight diracs in 2D
g = sdot.Image( np.random.rand( 10, 10 ) ) # pixels

print( sdot.w2( f, g ) ) # use the 2 norm as the ground metric by default
```

If not already loaded or specified, Sdot automatically picks the best available backend (JAX, PyTorch, ...) and device. [Configure it →](/guide/backends)

## What is Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport?

Given a discrete measure **f** (a weighted sum of Dirac masses) and a continuous density **g**, semi-discrete OT finds the _power diagram_ (Laguerre tessellation) that partitions space so that the mass of each cell matches the weight of the corresponding Dirac.

The solution is unique, and can be computed via a provably-convergent Newton algorithm in **O(n log n)** time — making it practical for very large number of points in 2D, 3D or more, and can easily achieves machine precision if required.

$$f = \sum_i m_i \, \delta_{y_i}, \qquad g = \text{continuous density on } \Omega$$

$$\text{Find } w \text{ such that } \int_{C_i(w)} g(x) \, dx = m_i \quad \forall i$$

Of courses, sdot allows to access quantities of the transport plan.

```python
from sdot import SplineGrid, SumOfDiracs, optimal_transport_plan
import numpy as np

f = np.random.random( [ 30, 2 ] ) * 2 - 1 # dirac positions
g = Box( frame = [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 2, 0 ], [ 2, 0 ] ] )

plan = optimal_transport_plan( f, g )

print( plan.barycenters ) # centroid of each transport cell
print( plan.cells )       # batch of cells, with possible access to vertices, edges, ... with gradient enabled
print( plan.second_order_moments ) # ...

plan.backward_map.brenier_potential.plot()  # the dual potential ψ
```

### Use inside JAX/Torch

Virtually all the outputs can generated gradients. Here is an example with `distance`:

```python
@jax.jit
def loss( positions ):
    f = SumOfGaussians( positions )
    g = SumOfDiracs( diracs )
    return distance( f, g )

diracs = np.random.normal( [ 1, 2 ], 0.3, size = ( 50, 2 ) )
grad = jax.grad( loss )( jnp.array( [ 0.0, 0.0 ] ) )
```

Of course, it applies on all the other quantities (e.g. barycenters, cell vertices) with respect to all input quantities (images values, ...).
